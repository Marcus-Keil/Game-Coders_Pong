# Game-Coders-Pong
Here is the files of my Unity project for the Game-Coders London meetup first programming challenge, Pong. 

My aim is to make a top down classic pong game, with 3d visual focusing mostly on shaders to make it look futuristic.

To do/wish list

UI:
  - Settings
    = Options for controlls
    = Sound settings
  - About
    = Credits if any software or sounds are used that are not mine
    = Acknowledgment of the Meetup that encouraged me to do this

Advanced game mechanics (advanced for me that is):
  - Add Bot to play one paddle, player chooses prefered side
  - Add power-ups/special moves such as holding the ball etc.*

Music:
  - Find suitable free licensed sound effects and music to add
  - Write own background song*

*If time permits
