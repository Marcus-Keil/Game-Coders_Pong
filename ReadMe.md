# Game-Coders-Pong
Here is the files of my Unity project for the Game-Coders London meetup first programming challenge, Pong. 

My aim is to make a top down classic pong game, with 3d visual focusing mostly on shaders to make it look futuristic.

Basic To-Do list:

Base game mechanics:
  - Player Controls (both paddles one keyboard)
  - basic game mechanics of Pong (ball movement and bounce)
  - Score board with timer

UI:
  - Main Menu
    = Choice of single or multiplayer
  - Settings
    = Options for controlls
    = Sound settings
  - About
    = Credits if any software or sounds are used that are not mine
    = Acknowledgment of the Meetup that encouraged me to do this

Advanced game mechanics (advanced for me that is):
  - Add Bot to play one paddle, player chooses prefered side
  - Add power-ups/special moves such as holding the ball etc.*

Visuals:
  - Add shaders and VFX to the Ball
  - Add shaders and VFX to the Paddles
  - Add shaders and VFX to the Arena

Music:
  - Find suitable MIT licensed sound effects and music to add
  - Write own wbackground song*
